# dq-student-notebook
An open-source differential equations student notebook.


# If you want to contribute to the project
1. Download and use a LaTeX .tex compiler. For simplicity's sake, I reccomend installing [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
2. Clone the project on your personal computer, and then upload (at minimum) the figures folder, the .tex file and the .pdf file.
3. Thanks for helping out :)
